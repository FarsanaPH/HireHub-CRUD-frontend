# HireHub

A React-based Job Management Portal where admins can seamlessly manage job listings with full CRUD functionality — all from a clean and responsive dashboard.  
It is designed to streamline the process of adding, updating, deleting and managing job listings with ease.  
Built with reusable components for better scalability and maintainability, and styled using React-Bootstrap for a responsive, modern UI.

## Project Purpose

This is an Admin-side project built to simulate real-world job management systems. It demonstrates proficiency in:

- Smart Component reusability (e.g., same modal reused for both Add and Edit job functionality)
- CRUD operations
- API integration


## Features

- Full CRUD Functionality (Add / View / Update / Delete Jobs)
- Component Reusability (Same modal used to Add & Edit job)
- Instant Updated Preview from Backend on Dashboard
- Responsive UI using Bootstrap + React-Bootstrap
- Fast Development using Vite + React


## Tech Stack

- **React** – Component-based UI
- **React-Bootstrap** – Layout, Component Styling & Responsiveness
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** – Functional logic
- **JSON Server** – Mock REST API for fast prototyping
- **Node.js** – Backend runtime
- **Vite** – Ultra-fast development build tool
